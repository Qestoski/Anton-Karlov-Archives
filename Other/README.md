## Info
This contains a number of games which are beta tests or are not even fully fledged games.

### Santa Is Coming
a christmas game, it isn't really that much intresting.

### RailBot
This is not even a game, it is just a background of the game where you can scrollright and left to see the full background.

### TowerDefense
It is a basic tower defence game, where you can put multiple turrets, and there are enemies that game, jeeps, tanks, soldiers and other enemies.

### PlayerShot
It is almost the same as RailBot, but it is for showing effects & how the game will be like, not the background.
