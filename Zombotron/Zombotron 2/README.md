## Zombotron 2
The original game from [**here**](https://zombotron.com/games/Zombotron2.swf).

### Prototype
This is the *oldest* known version of Zombotron 2, as it only had the basic elements. The player will be controller a car with a turret on top, and you can run over zombies and obsticles(boxes) or shoot them. The zombies do not have helmets, despite it being contained inside the game.
