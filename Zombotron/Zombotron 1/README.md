## Zombotron 1
Nothing special, just the original game. Found in [here](https://zombotron.com/games/Zombotron.swf)

### Flashpoint
This version of the game is in vietnamese, it seems that it was translated. The player's head sprit has also been changed in favor of one containing a bit of a glint on the top left of his head. Enemies that spot you won't attack you, unless you get in physical touch with them, and the physics are a bit abnormal.

### Miniclip
The game is uite normal at first site, with nothing to be said unless you enter the game in **Fullscreen** mode. Which makes it possible to see outside your normal point of view, and this is the only abnormality in the game.

### Version 1.3
The latest version of Zombotron 1 is 1.4, so this is just an older version of the game, and we don't know what has changed, and most likely extensive research will not be conducted. Unless one of the people reading this decides to do it for us.

You can find the original swf in [here](https://www.arcadeprehacks.com/game/13657/Zombotron.html)
> We modified the version provided in the repository so that it doesn't contain hacks.

### Old
This version is a slightly older version of the [**Zombotron.swf**](https://zombotron.com/games/Zombotron.swf) file, older by about a month. This version is unplayable, because of the bug rendering the armorgames banner in the bug. This bug is fixed in the latest version of the game.
